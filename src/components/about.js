                        I'm using various technologies to create user-friendly, 
                        accessible and well-designed online solutions. The work
                        presented here was created on my journey to become a web developer and some was 
                        developed recently. To see the technologies I work with view my projects below.

                        I graduated from Resilient coders bootcamp we met daily for eight weeks, 
                        to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and git, from professionals. 
                        I can now demonstrate proficiency in semantically structured markup, 
                        inheritance and specificity, accessibility, progressive 
                        enhancement, responsive design, and effective use of OOP

                        I’ve been told I can’t by many, but that has never stopped me from persevering 
                        and getting to where I am today I have a unique drive and ambition. I am a leader,
                        aspiring full-stack developer, and an optimist. I am pursuing an opportunity to be a part of a development team that creates amazing products 
                        that resolve real world issues.
